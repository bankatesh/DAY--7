Hey everyone!
I'have created a Voice Assistant using Python Language.
The implemented assistant can open up the application and can be used to perform tasks: like
1.Search Google
2.Search Wikipedia 
3.YouTube 
4.Search stackoverflow
5.Play music
6.Tell us the current time
7.Sending Emails etc 

by just giving the voice command. It uses Google speech recognition API and google text to 
speech for voice input and output respectively.
